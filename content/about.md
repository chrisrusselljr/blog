#### Welcome to my site!  
My name is Chris Russell and I'm a 29 year old living in Los Angeles. I currently work at SpaceX as a Sr. Supply Chain Systems Analyst and decided to make this blog to share my thoughts. Some of my favorite topics of interest include self-help, motivation, entrepreneurship, technology, software development, nutrition, and music production. 

Feel free to reach out to my personal mail [here](mailto:chris.russell02@gmail.com). You can also check out my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisrusselljr/).
