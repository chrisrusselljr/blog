I often bake desserts for friends and family. It’s not a regular occurrence, but it always results in good feelings. Who doesn’t love a [chocolate chip cookie](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/12/the-food-lab-best-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe.html)? Unfortunately, my budget of high-quality dark chocolate and free time limits this giving, as does the size of my oven and kitchenaid mixer. Usually, the best yields are 10-15 quick sparks of joy and energy from a single batch.   

Not bad – 15:1 ratio for a few hours of work. However, what would happen if I were suddenly thrust into the working life of a professional baker? Eight hours a day, toiling away at my creations. I don’t think I would quite enjoy that situation as much as my hobby. Having the autonomy to decide when and where to commit my time allows me to enjoy the results.  

Enter Rick and Stephanie Jaworski of iFood Media LLC and their hugely popular website, [joyofbaking.com](https://www.joyofbaking.com/). As of December 2020, they’ve created 600+ video recipe demonstrations and amassed 1.4 million [Youtube followers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjd060Z3nTHv0UyO8M43mQ). All given away at a whim, with zero resistance. The Jaworskis have managed to leverage two unique skill sets into an incredibly successful business. I personally have relied on their content to build my skillset and win many accolades. 

There are more ways to give than just doing more. As humans, we are limited in our capacity to exert effort – so we must develop our own innovating path to multiply our output.  

I used to DJ local Charleston bars back in 2018 as a side hustle for some extra cash. It was a hugely ego-boosting role. I was the center of attention for four hours. I controlled the dance floor. I controlled the energy. It was all about me. A dream job, I thought.

Until one day, I stopped enjoying it, so I quit.  

I wasn’t playing my own music (nor did I have any at the time). The nights would come and go as fast as the money I made. It was a constant hustle. How could I call myself a creative if I wasn’t creating anything? I would spend all week preparing my sets and not making music like I knew I should be. 

When I think about my life now, I always try to move in the direction where I am impacting the greatest number of people possible, while still maintaining my personal autonomy. My newly found passion for [music production](https://soundcloud.com/crussell) is a byproduct of that thinking. So is this blog.   

I miss DJing, but know this break is only temporary. As [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2017/10/the-pleasurehappiness-gap/) says:  
>Scratching an itch is a route to pleasure. Learning to productively live with an itch is part of happiness. 

Wish me luck.
