I never knew what I wanted to do when I grew up – and then I grew up.

Until I was about 27 years old - I studied, graduated, studied some more, got a degree, then another… my life was a continuous stream of achievement and reorientation, always reaching for the next accolade. Regardless of these achievements, the truly best moments of my life up to that point were those when I was either DJing a party or going to music festivals with friends. Something was disconnected. Why couldn’t my career be as fulfilling and rewarding as my social life? As it turns out - this is an entirely possible scenario. It took me a few years (and companies) to figure out, but here are my top 3 prerequisites for finding balance and fulfillment in your professional career. 

### **Find a BIG problem that excites you**  

Until I worked at SpaceX, I didn’t understand what it meant to work for a mission-based company. Essentially, a mission-based workplace removes ego. No debate, decision, or challenge I face effects my perception of the work I'm doing.

At SpaceX, everyone is working towards the same goal – to make humanity multiplanetary. 

The passion I hear in engineer’s voices when they challenge me and my supply base comes off as passion rather than friction. I rarely have to bring my guard up when collaborating or debating simply because the people I work with REALLY care about what they're doing. 

Once you find what BIG challenges excite you, look at the companies solving those problems and convince them to let you help. 

### **Don’t settle until you’re on your highest trajectory**

It’s OK not to have a plan. 

As long as you’re taking action and moving in the general direction of your goals, you will have time to iterate your strategy along the way. You don’t have to BE right; you only have to eventually GET it right. If something isn’t working, try something else. If you’ve exhausted all of your options at one place, try somewhere new. Never stagnate out of fear of failure and never settle until you’ve found a role that continuously challenges you and extracts your highest output. Only in these positions will you be able to grow at your highest trajectory.

### **Be extremely aware of your mental and emotional state**

It is abnormal to be unproductive and unhappy at work. Do not accept these conditions as standard. Know that there is a role and seat somewhere out there where you will be able to consistently show up and deliver excellent results. Stay keenly aware of your emotional state and mental wellbeing. Strive to show up each day to work calm, relaxed, and ready to take on the most difficult challenges. Consistency is essential in developing trust with your teams and customers.
