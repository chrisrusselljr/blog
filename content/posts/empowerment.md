>"If you don’t have a plan for yourself, you’ll become a part of someone else's. - Jim Rohn 

I write this in my notebook and look at it multiple times day.  

 
## If you want something in life, you need to develop a plan.

Nothing will be given to you.

Determine what you want and the necessary steps to get there.

Then execute, every day, without apology.

Empowerment means *you are in control* of your path.

## Everyone is competing to get to the next level.

If you’re good at what you do, consider yourself a resource.

Be helpful, but not at the cost of your plan.

To compromise your bandwidth is stagnation. 

There are enough problems in the world to satisfy everyone.
