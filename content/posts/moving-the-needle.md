Every morning after rolling out of bed, I ask myself the same question: “How can I move the needle today?” I find myself asking the same question right before falling asleep, too. Now that I’m going into the office, I ask myself this question walking along the chain fenced pathway from the parking lot. It’s stuck in my head and always repeating. 
 
Moving the needle means making a **NOTICEABLE** impact to your organization. 


From [Seth's Blog](https://seths.blog/2021/02/im-just-doing-my-job/):

>When we do our job, what happens to it? Does it go away, to be replaced by tomorrow’s endless list of tasks? What would happen if we had enough confidence and trust to reconsider the implications of how we do what we do?”

What Seth is saying is that just doing your job is **NEVER** going to move the needle.

How many roles have you held where the daily grind serves only to make room for tomorrow's problems? Where the effort and hours of your day act only as a bucket removing water from a sinking ship? For me, this has been the story for most of my career, even up to the minute of sharing this post. 


We need to fix the problem that requires us. We need to reconsider the implications of how we work. Don't just do your job - transform your job. Reinvent you job. Humanity has bigger problems that need our attention - so let’s fix the role we’re in and move on to the next issue.
