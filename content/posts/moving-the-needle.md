Every morning, rolling out of bed, I ask myself the same question: “How am I going to move the needle today?” I find myself asking the same question right before falling asleep. Now that I’m going into the office, I ask myself the same question walking through the chain fence pathway from the parking lot. It’s stuck in my head and always repeating.  
 
Moving the needle means making a **NOTICEABLE** impact to your organization. 


As Seth Godin asks in his February [blog post](https://seths.blog/2021/02/im-just-doing-my-job/):


>When we do our job, what happens to it? Does it go away, to be replaced by tomorrow’s endless list of tasks? What would happen if we had enough confidence and trust to reconsider the implications of how we do what we do?”

 

In summary - just doing your job is **NEVER** going to move the needle.

 

How many roles have you held where the daily grind serves only to make room for tomorrow's problems? Where the effort and hours of your day act as a bucket removing water from a sinking ship? For me, it's been most of my career, even up to the minute of sharing this post.

 

We need to fix the underlying problem or process that requires us. We need to reconsider the implications of how we work. Humanity has bigger problems that need our attention - so let’s fix the role we’re in and move on to the next issue.
