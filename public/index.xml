      <title>Tutorial: Hosting a Private IPFS Gateway</title>

      <description>Introduction One of the last steps of an NFT project is hosting the images and metadata of each token so Marketplace-ready. Most commonly, NFT assets are stored using the IPFS (Inter Planetary File System). IPFS is an open source, peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.
An IPFS Gateway resolves access to any requested IPFS content identifier, allowing browsers and applications access to IPFS content.</description>

      <description>Balance is the enemy of progress
You can’t do it all
But you can have it all
Inspiration expires
So start building
And get lost</description>

      <title>Self Empowerment</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you don’t have a plan for yourself, you’ll become a part of someone else&amp;rsquo;s. - Jim Rohn
 I write this in my notebook and look at it multiple times day.
If you want something in life, you need to develop a plan. Nothing will be given to you.
Determine what you want and the necessary steps to get there.
Then execute, every day, without apology.
Empowerment means you are in control of your path.</description>

      <title>Five tips for effective team members</title>
      <link>https://chrisrussell.blog/posts/effective-team-members/</link>

      <description>Do not impede other&amp;rsquo;s work Good teammates do not impede other&amp;rsquo;s work. This applies in both vertical and horizontal relationships. If your Manager plans to implement a process that will impede your team, is it your absolute obligation to speak up. If your coworker is working on a project, you must not impede their progress in any way, unless their actions directly impact you.
Speak Up Authenticity is perishable. From the moment you feel it in your gut, the countdown begins.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Ask for Feedback</title>

      <description>Don’t Ask for Feedback You’re already awesome.
You don&amp;rsquo;t need anyone to verify this.
Good teammates/managers will tell you what to work on.
They’re called blind spots for a reason.
Ask specific questions if you have them.
Let people rip into your work. Don’t get defensive. Thank them profusely.
Let your guard down.
Listen to their words, hear what they say, then do what you want – others will do the same.</description>

      <title>Move The Needle</title>

      <description>Every morning after rolling out of bed, I ask myself the same question: “How can I move the needle today?” I find myself asking the same question right before falling asleep, too. Now that I’m going into the office, I ask myself this question walking along the chain fenced pathway from the parking lot. It’s stuck in my head and always repeating.
Moving the needle means making a NOTICEABLE impact to your organization.</description>

      <title>Three tips on finding fulfillment in your career</title>

      <description>I never knew what I wanted to do when I grew up – and then I grew up.
Until I was about 27 years old - I studied, graduated, studied some more, got a degree, then another… my life was a continuous stream of achievement and reorientation, always reaching for the next accolade. Regardless of these achievements, the truly best moments of my life up to that point were those when I was either DJing a party or going to music festivals with friends.</description>

      <title>Why I made my resume in LaTeX (&#43; free template)</title>

      <guid>https://chrisrussell.blog/posts/why-i-made-my-resume-in-latex/</guid>
      <description>I’ve received a few job offers in my life and even more rejection letters. One thing that has always followed me along the way is my resume. The resume is a standard requirement during most application processes because it sums you up into one easy to digest page. For this reason alone, you must do everything you can to make it easy to read and effectively communicate the right information about who you are.</description>

      <description>Why a blog? At 28, it feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way, but I know this is only just the beginning. As I write, I hope to capture my ideas and my current mindset, maybe even provide some guidance to those who need it.
As of today, I work for SpaceX on the Dragon Supply Chain Team as a Buyer for mechanisms and mechanical assemblies. Prior to this, I was a Buyer at Volvo Cars USA, as awell as a Buyer and Mechanical Engineer for TRU Simulation.</description>
