      <description>I never knew what I wanted to do when I grew up – and then I grew up.
Until I was about 27 years old - I studied, graduated, studied some more, got a degree, then another… my life was a continuous stream of achievement and reorientation, always reaching for the next accolade. Regardless of these achievements, the truly best moments of my life up to that point were those when I was either DJing a party or going to music festivals with my friends.</description>

      <description>I’ve received a few job offers in my life and even more rejection letters. One thing that has always followed me along the way is my resume. The resume is a standard requirement during most application processes because it sums you up into one easy to digest page. For this reason alone, you must do everything you can to make it easy to read and effectively communicate the right information about who you are.</description>

      <title>Make Something</title>

      <description>I often bake desserts for friends and family. It’s not a regular occurrence, but it always results in good feelings. Who doesn’t love a chocolate chip cookie? Unfortunately, my budget of high-quality dark chocolate and free time limits this giving, as does the size of my oven and kitchenaid mixer. Usually, the best yields are 10-15 quick sparks of joy and energy from a single batch.
Not bad – 15:1 ratio for a few hours of work.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my site! My name is Chris Russell and I&amp;rsquo;m a 28 year old living in Los Angeles, California. I currently work at SpaceX as a Buyer for the Dragon Supply Chain and decided to make this blog to share my ideas some might find useful. Some of my favorite topics of interest include self-help, motivation, entrepreneurship, technology, nutrition, and music production.

      <description>Why a blog? At 28, it feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way, but I know this is only just the beginning. As I write, I hope to capture my ideas and my current mindset, maybe even provide some guidance to those who need it.
As of today, I work for SpaceX on the Dragon Supply Chain Team as a Buyer for mechanisms and mechanical assemblies. Prior to this, I was a Buyer at Volvo Cars USA, as awell as a Buyer and Mechanical Engineer for TRU Simulation.</description>
