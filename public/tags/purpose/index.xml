      <description>I often bake desserts for friends and family. It’s not a regular occurrence, but it always results in good feelings. Who doesn’t love a chocolate chip cookie? Unfortunately, my budget of high-quality dark chocolate and free time limits this giving, as does the size of my oven and kitchenaid mixer. Usually, the best yields are 10-15 quick sparks of joy and energy from a single batch.
Not bad – 15:1 ratio for a few hours of work.</description>
