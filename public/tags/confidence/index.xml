      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you don’t have a plan for yourself, you’ll become a part of of their&amp;rsquo;s.
 I write this in my notebook and look at it multiple times day.
If you want something in life, you need to develop a plan. Nothing in your carrer will be given to you.
Determine what you want and the necessary steps to get there.
Then execute, every day, without apology.
Empowerment means you are in control of your path</description>

      <description>Don’t Ask for Feedback You’re already awesome.
You don&amp;rsquo;t need anyone to verify this.
Good teammates will tell you what to work on.
They’re called blind spots for a reason.
Ask specific questions if you have them.
Let people rip into your work. Don’t get defensive. Thank them profusely.
Let your guard down.
Listen to their words, hear what they say, then do what you want – others will do the same.</description>
