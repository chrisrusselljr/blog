      <description>Balance is the enemy of progress
You can’t do it all
But you can have it all
Inspiration expires
So start building
And get lost</description>

      <description>From Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Man in the Arena&amp;rdquo; - April 23, 1910
 &amp;ldquo;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</description>

      <title>Self Empowerment</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you don’t have a plan for yourself, you’ll become a part of someone else&amp;rsquo;s. - Jim Rohn
 I write this in my notebook and look at it multiple times day.
If you want something in life, you need to develop a plan. Nothing will be given to you.
Determine what you want and the necessary steps to get there.
Then execute, every day, without apology.
Empowerment means you are in control of your path.</description>

      <title>Five tips for effective team members</title>

      <description>Do not impede other&amp;rsquo;s work Good teammates do not impede other&amp;rsquo;s work. This applies in both vertical and horizontal relationships. If your Manager plans to implement a process that will impede your team, is it your absolute obligation to speak up. If your coworker is working on a project, you must not impede their progress in any way, unless their actions directly impact you.
Speak Up Authenticity is perishable. From the moment you feel it in your gut, the countdown begins.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Ask for Feedback</title>

      <description>Don’t Ask for Feedback You’re already awesome.
You don&amp;rsquo;t need anyone to verify this.
Good teammates/managers will tell you what to work on.
They’re called blind spots for a reason.
Ask specific questions if you have them.
Let people rip into your work. Don’t get defensive. Thank them profusely.
Let your guard down.
Listen to their words, hear what they say, then do what you want – others will do the same.</description>

      <title>Move The Needle</title>

      <description>Every morning after rolling out of bed, I ask myself the same question: “How can I move the needle today?” I find myself asking the same question right before falling asleep, too. Now that I’m going into the office, I ask myself this question walking along the chain fenced pathway from the parking lot. It’s stuck in my head and always repeating.
Moving the needle means making a NOTICEABLE impact to your organization.</description>

      <description>I never knew what I wanted to do when I grew up – and then I grew up.
Until I was about 27 years old - I studied, graduated, studied some more, got a degree, then another… my life was a continuous stream of achievement and reorientation, always reaching for the next accolade. Regardless of these achievements, the truly best moments of my life up to that point were those when I was either DJing a party or going to music festivals with friends.</description>
