      <description>Don’t Ask for Feedback You’re already awesome
You don’t need anyone to verify this.
Good teammates will tell you what to work on.
They’re called blind spots for a reason.
Ask specific questions if you have them.
Let people rip into your work. Don’t get defensive. Thank them profusely.
Let your guard down.
Listen to their words, hear what they say, then do what you want – others will do the same.</description>
