      <description>Do not impede other&amp;rsquo;s work Good teammates do not impede other&amp;rsquo;s work. This applies in both vertical and horizontal relationships. If your Manager plans to implement a process that will impede your team, is it your absolute obligation to speak up. If your coworker is working on a project, you must not impede their progress in any way, unless their actions directly impact you.
Speak Up Authenticity is perishable. From the moment you feel it in your gut, the countdown begins.</description>

      <description>Don’t Ask for Feedback You’re already awesome.
You don&amp;rsquo;t need anyone to verify this.
Good teammates/managers will tell you what to work on.
They’re called blind spots for a reason.
Ask specific questions if you have them.
Let people rip into your work. Don’t get defensive. Thank them profusely.
Let your guard down.
Listen to their words, hear what they say, then do what you want – others will do the same.</description>
